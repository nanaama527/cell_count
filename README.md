# cell_count_takehome

This program was made for a take home technical assessment. It's made to test and count active cells in a simulation

The exercise is part of a cell based simulation. The simulation is given a 3x3 grid with specific cells active. Count the number of active neighbors around a given cell.
Every cell has eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

# Setup

Fork the repository to your local computer.

Before running the program, please navigate into the CELL_COUNT repo and make sure to run 'gem install mocha'. The mocha gem is used for testing purposes.


# Testing

Navigate into the testing folder, there are three files but only two tests
You can run these tests by entering ruby <file_name>.rb and pressing enter
    Example: ruby cell_test.rb

# Running The Program 

Navigate into the lib folder and enter the following command in your terminal ruby run.rb
Your output in the terminal will look like this: "There are X active cells."
